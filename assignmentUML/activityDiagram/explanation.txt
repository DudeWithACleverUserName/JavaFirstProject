Activity diagram of an Order Management System

Series of activities are as follows:

-> The process starts with the customer sending an order request.
-> Next the order request system confirms the receipt of the order.
-> Type of the order is identified(normal or special).
-> If the order type is different from the above two then the process is terminated.
-> Else the order is confirmed and dispatched and the process is terminated.
